Welcome to the Python knots and crosses game. The game operates as follows:

The board is 3 x 3 and the positions are labelled as left, middle, right, and upper, middle, lower. This means the top left corner is LU for left upper, and the bottom middle is ML for middle lower, and so on. You enter the x-axis character first and then the y-axis character. You enter two characters to have your move placed on the board. 

In two player mode and single player mode, if you enter invalid characters or enter a move which has already been taken, then this counts as an invalid move, and your turn will be skipped. 

In single player mode easy, the AI will sometimes enter invalid moves. 

In single player mode medium, the AI will always place a piece on the board, never an invalid move. 

In single player mode hard, the AI will always place a piece on the board and will attempt to stop you from winning. 

The game is simply for entertainment and to showcase my Python programming skills. I hope you enjoy playing the game and would like to thank you for taking the time to do this.
